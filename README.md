## Introduction

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

## Documentation

The nf-core/smartseq pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline, found in the `docs/` directory:

1. [Installation](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)
2. Pipeline configuration
   - [Local installation](https://nf-co.re/usage/local_installation)
   - [Adding your own system config](https://nf-co.re/usage/adding_own_config)
   - [Reference genomes](https://nf-co.re/usage/reference_genomes)
3. [Running the pipeline](docs/usage.md)
4. [Output and how to interpret the results](docs/output.md)
5. [Troubleshooting](https://nf-co.re/usage/troubleshooting)

This pipeline was developed to process single cell RNA-seq data generated
using the [Smart-Seq2 protocol](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2014.006).

The pipeline features:

- Quality control using `fastqc` and `multiqc`
- Alignment using `STAR`
- Quantification using `rsem` or `featureCounts`
- TCR analysis using `TraCeR`.
- BCR analysis using `BraCeR`.
